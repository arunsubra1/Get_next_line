#42 - LIBFT

My implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions including some additional ones.

What is Libft?

Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program. 

Why Libft?

Although this project requires us to recreate standard functions used in C the purpose is to get a greater fundamental understanding of data structures and basic algorithms.
